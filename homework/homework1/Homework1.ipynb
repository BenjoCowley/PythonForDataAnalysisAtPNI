        "You have just collected data from a neuroscientific experiment! A subject performed a stimulus-change detection task. The subject watches a stimulus (a filled square on a gray screen) and waits for the stimulus to change luminances (i.e., the square changes from black to white). Once the subject detects a stimulus change, they hit a button. We record the time it takes for the subject to detect a change (called the reaction time: the time between the stimulus change and the button press). \n",
